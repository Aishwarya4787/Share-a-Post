# Understanding MIXED REALITY(MR) Technology


Mixed reality is the result of blending the physical world with the digital world.

Mixed Reality (MR) is used as an independent concept or to classify the spectrum of reality technologies, as referenced in the reality–virtuality continuum.
                                  
Mixed reality is the next evolution in human, computer, and environment interaction and unlocks possibilities that before now were restricted to our imaginations.
It is made possible by advancements in computer vision, graphical processing power, display technology, and input systems.

The term mixed reality was originally introduced in a 1994 paper by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino, "A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Displays".
Their paper introduced the concept of the virtuality continuum and focused on how the categorization of taxonomy applied to displays.
Since then, the application of mixed reality goes beyond displays but also includes environmental input, spatial sound, and location.

As an independent concept, mixed reality combines the best of both virtual reality and augmented reality.
When used to classify the larger scope of reality technologies, it refers to the coverage of all possible variations and compositions of real and virtual objects.


### Mixed Reality Defintion (Independent)
The predominantly virtual spaces where real world objects or people are dynamically integrated into virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.

### Mixed Reality Definition (Continuum)
The continuous scale ranging which covers all possible variations and compositions of real and virtual objects.
The continuum ranges from a completely real and natural environment, to a completely virtual environment.
The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram.


### The mixed reality spectrum

Since mixed reality is the blending of the physical world and digital world, these two realities define the polar ends of a spectrum known as the virtuality continuum. 
For simplicity, we refer to this as the mixed reality spectrum.
On the left-hand side we have physical reality in which we, humans, exist. 
Then on the right-hand side we have the corresponding digital reality.
Most mobile phones on the market today have little to no environmental understanding capabilities.
Thus the experiences they offer cannot mix between physical and digital realities.
The experiences that overlay graphics on video streams of the physical world are augmented reality, and the experiences that occlude your view to present a digital experience are virtual reality.
As you can see, the experiences enabled between these two extremes is mixed reality:

 * Starting with the physical world, placing a digital object, such as a hologram, as if it was really there.

 * Starting with the physical world, a digital representation of another person – an avatar – shows the location where they were standing when leaving notes. In other words, experiences that represent asynchronous collaboration at different points in time.

 * Starting with a digital world, physical boundaries from the physical world, such as walls and furniture, appear digitally within the experience to help users avoid physical objects.
