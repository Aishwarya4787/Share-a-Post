__**Artificial intelligence** is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.__

Research associated with artificial intelligence is highly technical and specialized. The core problems of artificial intelligence include programming computers for certain traits such as:

*Knowledge*
*Reasoning*
*Problem solving*
*Perception*
*Learning*
*Planning*
Ability to manipulate and move objects
##Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
__*Artificial Intelligence (AI)* uses different techniques to mimic clerical tasks and decisions taken by staff and learns from experience. The application of AI allows tasks that are staff intensive to be processed more efficiently. Applied within business processes, artificial intelligence has the power to improve business processes by streamlining and automating workflow execution and decision-making.
Configuring an intelligent system that is able to read and understand semi-structured and unstructured documents and extract key information, allows businesses to maximise their potential. These systems recognise patterns as a natural consequence of processing data, resulting in continuous improvements in performance as well as reducing the need for manual intervention through improved quality. Processing unstructured data like emails, chat or social media messages by applying Artificial Intelligence leads to almost instantaneous benefits, improving accuracy significantly within the first 24 hours and a reduction of manual work by 75% within the first three months of implementation.
*Artificial intelligence* was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).__
