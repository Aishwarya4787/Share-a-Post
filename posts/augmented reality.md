*Augmented reality* is a digital extension of product design.
AR is an interactive experience of a real-world environment whereby the objects.
It reside in the real-world are "*augmented*" by computer-generated perceptual information sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory,etc..

The *future of design tools is wonderful* and here's a guide to design an AR on one's cellphone.
                  
But first, there is no ‘AR Thing’. There are problems that need solving, and these problems have constraints and that may be overcome by thinking spatially. 

The first step in finding out if AR is the right medium is by identifying the users and their needs. 
Are there physical constraints that currently prevent them from being successful? 
If so, then there’s a good chance that Augmented Reality can add value to the solution.
         
One of the *superpowers* of AR is **knowledge transfer**: If you compare the theory of gravity with black holes.
Theoretically, we are more knowledgeable about gravity because we can experience it as opposed to a black hole which we can only observe.
Therefore, having your users experience rather than observe may sharply increase the chances of them understanding and retaining information
Having your users experience rather than observe may sharply increase the chances of them understanding and retaining information. 
That’s what makes AR such an interesting platform and thus a compelling medium for education and training.

## Constraints
                                                          
The principles of thinking apply with a few modifications. 
Rather than having physical constraints, the user now has technological constraints and affordances.

Following are the most rated constraits of the AR among the Reviewed Studies:
   1) Technical issues with AR apps
   2) The shortage of AR based materials
   3) The cost of ready made AR available in the market                     
   4) The compilation to create and operate AR technology 

And hence, these constraints must be eradicated to have an efficient working.
This means the world no longer binds the user, however, they are still limited by material constraints determined by the technology.
A great example is an older generation iPhone without a motion or depth sensor versus a newer model with that technology. 

The earlier models are unable to calculate the depth data necessary for a smooth experience.
Therefore it is a constraint. 
Although not even close to the accuracy of a sensor,this is an excellent example of how valuable thinking beyond the current technological capabilities is. 
            
            
## Content Types
                                                           
Language plays a critical role when defining your experience. 

The following are examples of some of the more popular content types used within AR:

**_Static_**: Content that is still and lacks movement and interaction

**_Animated_**: Contentthat moves on a timeline or follows a sequence

**_3D_**: Content with width, height and depth or data with XYZ coordinates

**_Dynamic_**: Adaptive content that changes with interaction or over time
    
**_Procedural_**: Content generated automatically or algorithmically
            
            
            
## Interactions
                                                           
When mapping out behaviors and relationships in AR, it is helpful to be specific about where and how to treat the content. 
A good rule of thumb is to call out the location (e.g., glass, space, object…),the content type (e.g., static, 3D…) and the state of content (e.g., fixed, locked, flexible…)               
* _FIXED ON GLASS_
* _LOCKED IN SPACE_
* _FLEXIBLE ON GLASS_          
* _DYNAMIC 3D & FLEXIBLE IN SPACE_             
* _PROPORTIONATE IN SPACE_           
                                            
                                             
AR also has great potential for marketing.
Since it involves having the user completely immersed in the experience; 
it is a known metric that full immersion or engagement leads to a higher rate of conversion. 
A user is more likely to make a purchasing decision once they have tried out the product by themselves.

_**Have an interesting experience with AR!**_ **:)**
